# SmartBot_ICTC
Crafting the Resolution for the SmartBot Challenge in the Intra-College Tech Championship by the Students' Technical Council at IIT Patna

## Our Control System (in the link above) contains two modules:

- Bot Communication for ESP32 module.(ESP32 connects with android phone's WiFi & Receives the data)
- Bot Movement Arduino.(Arduino takes the data from ESP32 & Controls the Bot)
- sensAline(Android app uses Computer Vision for line detection)

## The following functions are implemented in the control system:

- Connects to Phone
- Start Reading the Line using OpenCV
- Sends Data from Phone to ESP32 using WiFi
- ESP32 receives the data and send to Arduino.
- Arduino moves as the bot as per the values received.
